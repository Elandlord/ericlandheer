                        Laravel has been my go-to framework in PHP since 2015. I have been working with it professionally for years,
                        and I have yet to encounter a (back-end) problem I could not solve with it.

                        Vue.js feels like a huge upgrade coming from Vanilla Javascript or jQuery. Even though other major
                        JS frameworks (React, Angular) offer a similar amount of functionality, I still prefer Vue.js as
                        it integrates seamlessly in Laravel projects.

                        Semantic classes like: top-navigation-header simply do not feel good. My colleague and I decided that in 2015.
                        We decided to use our own small, utility-first CSS framework (with its caveats).
                        Since Tailwindcss came along, we have used that in our projects and never looked back.

                        This sentence should be a thing of the past using Docker. I have been using Docker locally for years.
                        Even though I do not fully master deployment and orchestration with Docker (yet!), I do see the benefits it has and am <strong>keen</strong>
                        to develop my Docker-skills this the coming months.

                        What else can I say about Go besides: <i>"Go use it"</i>! It is small, relatively simple to learn and
                        scales really well. Even though Laravel (using PHP) is my go-to Framework for web-solutions, I have
                        been tinkering around with Go and see the possibilities of the language.

                        Firebase is on my list to learn. As a small hobby side-project, I have recently developed a small, simple application that allows users
                        to keep track of the location of their items. Using Firestore has been a different taste than old trusty Laravel and
                        a MySQL database.
